/// Converts a given civil time into the local sidereal time and vice-versa.

/// == Sidereal and Civil time
///
/// *Sidereal time* is reckoned by the daily transit of a fixed point in space
/// (fixed with respect to the distant stars), 24 hours of sidereal time elapsing
/// between an successive transits. The sidereal day is thus shorter than the
/// solar day by nearely 4 minutes, and although the solar and sidereal time
/// agree once a year, the difference between them grows systematically as the
/// months pass in the sense that sidereal time runs faster than solar time.
/// *Sidereal time* (ST) is used extensively by astronomers since it is the time
/// kept by the star.
///
/// == Caveats
///
/// Times may be converted quite easily from UT to Greenwich mean sidereal time
/// (SG) since **there is a small range of sidereal times which occurs twice on
/// the same calendar date**. The ambiguous period is from 23h 56m 04s UT to
/// Oh 03m 56s UT, i.e. about 4 minutes either side of midnight. The routine
/// given here correctly converts SG to UT in the period before midnight, but
/// not in the period after midnight when the ambiguity must be resolved by other
/// means.
